# 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix

# Given a n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, find the kth smallest element in the matrix.

# Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

# Example:

# matrix = [
#    [ 1,  5,  9],
#    [10, 11, 13],
#    [12, 13, 15]
# ],
# k = 8,

# return 13.
# Note:
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ n2.

# This works! but there must be a better way!

# Since the matrix is sorted, we do not need to put all the elements in heap at one time. 
# We can simply pop and put for k times. 
# By observation, if we look at the matrix diagonally, we can tell that if we do not pop matrix[i][j], 
# we do not need to put on matrix[i][j + 1] and matrix[i + 1][j] since they are bigger.

# e.g., given the matrix below:
# 1 2 4
# 3 5 7
# 6 8 9
# We put 1 first, then pop 1 and put 2 and 3, then pop 2 and put 4 and 5, then pop 3 and put 6...
