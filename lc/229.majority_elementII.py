# Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than âŒŠ n/3 âŒ‹ times.

# Note: The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.

# Example 1:

# Input: [3,2,3]
# Output: [3]
# Example 2:

# Input: [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]
# Output: [1,2]

            d) if its not in the dictionary but the length of the dictionary is less than 2, add it to the  dictionary with initial value of 1
            e) if its not in the dictionary and the length of the dictionary is 2 or more, for all the existing elements in the dictionary, decrement by 1 -> if its less than 0 -> delete from the dictionary
        
        step2: verify the count to see if its more than threshhold
            a) reset the count of all the elements in the dictionary to 0 and iterate through the input arr to count the frequency
            b) initialize an answer array
            c) iterate through the dictionary and if the count is larger than len(nums)/3 -> append the elem to the ans arr
