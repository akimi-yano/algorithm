# 1524. Number of Sub-arrays With Odd Sum

# Given an array of integers arr. Return the number of sub-arrays with odd sum.

# As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 10^9 + 7.

# Example 1:

# Input: arr = [1,3,5]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: All sub-arrays are [[1],[1,3],[1,3,5],[3],[3,5],[5]]
# All sub-arrays sum are [1,4,9,3,8,5].
# Odd sums are [1,9,3,5] so the answer is 4.
# Example 2:

# Input: arr = [2,4,6]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: All sub-arrays are [[2],[2,4],[2,4,6],[4],[4,6],[6]]
# All sub-arrays sum are [2,6,12,4,10,6].
# All sub-arrays have even sum and the answer is 0.
# Example 3:

# Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
# Output: 16
# Example 4:

# Input: arr = [100,100,99,99]
# Output: 4
# Example 5:

# Input: arr = [7]
# Output: 1


# Constraints:

# 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
# 1 <= arr[i] <= 100

#     def numOfSubarrays(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
#         odd = 0
#         n = len(arr)
#         for elem in arr:
#             if elem%2!=0:
#                 odd+=1

#         # print(odd)
#         total = math.factorial(odd+((n-odd)//2))
#         return total//2 +1

#         #         ans+=1
#         # ans = ans % (10**9 + 7)
#         # return ans
#     # (num_odd !)//2+1







# DP Solution that works!


# This is an elementary dynamic programming problem.
# odd[i] records the number of subarray ending at arr[i] that has odd sum.
# even[i] records the number of subarray ending at arr[i] that has even sum.
# if arr[i + 1] is odd, odd[i + 1] = even[i] + 1 and even[i + 1] = odd[i]
# if arr[i + 1] is even, odd[i + 1] = odd[i] and even[i + 1] = even[i] + 1
# Since we only required the previous value in odd and even, we only need O(1) space.

# If we do compute the cumulative sum array in temp[] of our input array, 
# then we can see that the sub-array starting from i and ending at j, 
# has an even sum if temp[] if (temp[j] â€“ temp[i]) % 2 = 0. So, 
# instead of building a cumulative sum array we build a cumulative sum modulo 2 array. 
# Then calculating odd-even pairs will give the required result i.e. temp[0]*temp[1].
