# Share
# You are given a binary matrix matrix of size m x n, and you are allowed to rearrange the columns of the matrix in any order.

# Return the area of the largest submatrix within matrix where every element of the submatrix is 1 after reordering the columns optimally.



# Example 1:



# Input: matrix = [[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[1,0,1]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: You can rearrange the columns as shown above.
# The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 4.
# Example 2:



# Input: matrix = [[1,0,1,0,1]]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: You can rearrange the columns as shown above.
# The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 3.
# Example 3:

# Input: matrix = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Notice that you must rearrange entire columns, and there is no way to make a submatrix of 1s larger than an area of 2.
# Example 4:

# Input: matrix = [[0,0],[0,0]]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: As there are no 1s, no submatrix of 1s can be formed and the area is 0.


# Constraints:

# m == matrix.length
# n == matrix[i].length
# 1 <= m * n <= 105
# matrix[i][j] is 0 or 1.


# This approach does not work
# class Solution:
#     def largestSubmatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
#         if matrix is None or matrix[0] is None:
#             return 0
#         M = len(matrix)
#         N = len(matrix[0])
#         for col in range(N):
#             for row in range(M):
#                 print(matrix[row][col])

# Example 1

# [0,0,1],
# [1,1,1],
# [1,0,1]

# For every column, we count the the number of continuous 1 by the current position. the result matrix will be

# [0,0,1],
# [1,1,2],
# [2,0,3]

# Now letâ€™s consider every row.
# For the first row, we reversely sort the row
# We got [1,0,0]. It's very easy to get the largest matrix for this row. For other rows, we do the same thing.

# For example, for the second row, We reversely sort the row,
# [2,1,1]
# For the third row, We reversely sort the row,
# [3,2,0]

# For each row, find the histogram height of each column.
# Sort it and find the max rectangle you could find(refer to Question 84).

# Time: O(m * n * log(n))
