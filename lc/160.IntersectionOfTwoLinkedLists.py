# Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

# For example, the following two linked lists:


# begin to intersect at node c1.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
# Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
# Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
 

# Example 2:


# Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
# Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
# Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
 

# Example 3:


# Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
# Output: null
# Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
# Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
 

# Notes:

# If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
# The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
# You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
# Each value on each linked list is in the range [1, 10^9].
# Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

# This solution works:

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if headA is None or headB is None:
            return None
        
        runner1 = headA
        runner2 = headB
        while (runner1 and runner2) and (runner1 is not runner2):
            
            runner1 = runner1.next
            runner2 = runner2.next
            
            if runner1 is runner2:
                break
            
            if not runner1:
                runner1 = headB    
            
            if not runner2:
                runner2 = headA
    
        return runner1
    

# This solution works:

class Solution:
    # @param two ListNodes
    # @return the intersected ListNode
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        if headA is None or headB is None:
            return None

        pa = headA # 2 pointers
        pb = headB

        while pa is not pb:
            # if either pointer hits the end, switch head and continue the second traversal, 
            # if not hit the end, just move on to next
            pa = headB if pa is None else pa.next
            pb = headA if pb is None else pb.next

        return pa # only 2 ways to get out of the loop, they meet or the both hit the end=None
