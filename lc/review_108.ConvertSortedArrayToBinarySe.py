# Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

# A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
# Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
# Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:

# Example 2:


# Input: nums = [1,3]
# Output: [3,1]
# Explanation: [1,null,3] and [3,1] are both height-balanced BSTs.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 104
# -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
# nums is sorted in a strictly increasing order.


# This solution works:


# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def sortedArrayToBST(self, nums: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
        def helper(l, r):
            if l > r:
                return None
            m = (l+r)//2
            node = TreeNode(nums[m])
            node.left = helper(l, m - 1)
            node.right = helper(m + 1, r)
            return node
        
        return helper(0, len(nums) - 1)
