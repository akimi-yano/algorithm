# Pascal's Triangle II

# Solution
# Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.

# Note that the row index starts from 0.


# In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

# Example:

# Input: 3
# Output: [1,3,3,1]
# Follow up:

# Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?


# this works - but lets see if we can optimize it

EXPLANATION:

say we get row = [1, 2, 1] from last iteration.
[0]+row gives us [0, 1, 2, 1] (appending 0 to the head); row+[0] gives us [1, 2, 1, 0].
Then we need to do the element-wise addition of the 2 lists.
zip() would give us element-wise zipped tuples: [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (1, 0)], which is a iterator actually.
then we use the list comprehension to do the actual addition.
