827. Making A Large Island
Hard
Topics
Companies
You are given an n x n binary matrix grid. You are allowed to change at most one 0 to be 1.

Return the size of the largest island in grid after applying this operation.

An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change one 0 to 1 and connect two 1s, then we get an island with area = 3.
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Change the 0 to 1 and make the island bigger, only one island with area = 4.
Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Can't change any 0 to 1, only one island with area = 4.
 

Constraints:

n == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 500
grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

        1) Explore every island using DFS, count its area, 
        give it an island index and save the result to a {index: area} map.
        2) Loop every cell == 0, check its connected islands and calculate 
        total islands area.
