# 204 - Sort Colors 

# Given an array of integers values of `0`, `1`, and `2` (representing Red, White, and Blue), sort them in linear time. 

# ```
# Input: Array of Integers where elements values belong to the set S : { 0, 1, 2 }
# Output: Sorted Array
# ```
# # Example
# ```
# Input: [2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0]	=>	Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
# Input: [1, 2, 2, 0]		=>	Output: [0, 1, 2, 2]
# ```
# # Constraints

# ```
# Time Complexity: O(N)
# Auxiliary Space Complexity: O(1)
# ```

# Using a native sorting method is not allowed.
