# 230 - Non-Consecutive Ones

# Given a positive integer `n`, return an array of all the binary strings of 
# length n that *DO NOT* contain consecutive `1`s.

# Input: n (Integer)
# Output: [Str] (Array of Strings)

# # Example

# Input: 2
# Output: ["00", "01", "10"]

# Input: 3
# Output: ["000", "001", "010", "100", "101"]

# # Constraints
# Time Complexity: O(2^N)
# Auxiliary Space Complexity: O(2^N)

# The order of the strings in the array does not matter.
# Use recursion to solve this problem.
