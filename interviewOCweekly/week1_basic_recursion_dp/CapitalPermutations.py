# 231 - Capital Permutations

# Given a string `str` of lowercase alphabetical characters, 
# return the set of all permutations of those characters in upper AND lowercase.

# ### Advanced

# Solve the same problem, except now you may have number characters in your string (which don't have a lowercase or uppercase, but should still be included in your result) and capital letters, that need to be lowercased.  


# ```
# Input: str (String)
# Output: [Str] (Array of Strings)
# ```

# # Example

# ```
# Input: "abc"
# Output: ["ABC", "ABc", "AbC", "aBC", "Abc", "aBc", "abC", "abc"]


# Advanced:

# Input: "A1d3"
# Output: ["A1D3", "a1D3", "A1d3", "a1d3"]
# ```

# # Constraints

# ```
# Time Complexity: O(2^N)
# Space Complexity: O(2^N)
# ```

# The order of the strings in the final result does not matter.

# In the basic solution, all the input characters will be lowercase letters.

# In the advanced solution, the input characters can be uppercase letters and numbers too.
